# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I am able to write programs in such a fashion because I focus on the objecct oriented principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. This means that the classes that I create contain the necessary information in an organized and easily resused fashion because they have few dependencies on difficult to repurpose compnents. My code is tested thoroughly in order to ensure that every implementation was successful. I also have a dedicated CRUD module which is fully portable to other databases that have a Pymongo structure. This was greatly advantageous because I was able to resuse my CRUD module in each stage of development of my dashboard.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach each problem with a dedicated test-driven process in which I follow iterative development strategies. This means that each part of the dashboard was developed in increments. This began with the necessary imports, then the CRUd module, and lastly the code for the dashboard. This ensured that at each stage of development I could test functionality. I plan to use this same process in my furture assignments as it has been what has worked for the classes I ahve taken so far. I will also use these strategies in the future for my client's requests. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I do not yet have much experience in the workplace, so I have not seen the actual work of computer scientists. I am, however, able to learn form the work of my professors. The follow very structured designs with thorough notation and a clearly defined and consistent code structure. This is very important because the process of code development requries review by many individuals who must understand the code easily. Grazioso Salvare will benefit from this because they will be able to reuse code within their company that maintins consistent standards.
